\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
At this point I would like to thank all people who supported me and made this thesis possible 
in the first place.

Furthermore, I would like to thank all people who have participated at the survey, which was needed to evaluate the meaningfulness of the diagrams, and all people who proofread my thesis.

%Last but not least I would like to thank my girlfriend for her patience in this busy time.
