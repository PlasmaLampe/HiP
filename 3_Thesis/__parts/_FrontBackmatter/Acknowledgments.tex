At this point I would like to thank all people who supported me and made this thesis possible 
in the first place. Thank you, Dr. Simon Oberth\"ur for doing a very good job as a supervisor. You were there, when I needed help; but on the other hand, I had a enough freedom to materialize my ideas and thoughts.

Furthermore, I would like to thank all people who proofread my thesis and Bj\"orn Senft for offering me the usability review. The review was very important and increased the quality of the backend recognizable.
