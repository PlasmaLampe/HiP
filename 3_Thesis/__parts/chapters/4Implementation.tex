\chapter[Implementation details]{Implementation details}
\label{implementation}

This chapter will show details about the implementation. However, note that the application is too complex to be explained in full detail in this chapter. Because of that, we will pick specific parts, which are important within the system and show these parts in this chapter.
Furthermore, we will show things that has been changed from the draft because the requirements came up within the implementation phase in the agile process. These changes are mostly features, which are not included in the general list of requirements (tables \ref{RequirementsBackendSupervisor}, \ref{RequirementsBackendStudent}, \ref{RequirementsBackendMaster}, \ref{RequirementsBackendMisc} and \ref{RequirementsFrontend}), because they were added afterwards as a result of discussions within the biweekly meetings with our 'customers'.
