\chapter[Testing the application]{Testing the application}
Although the section called \textit{testing} is the second last of this thesis, testing was a major force within the whole development process. We had to do changes on existing code parts often, which was the main reason for the \ac{TDD} development approach. So, the following section will contain the results of the final test suites for the current version of the HiP application. The tests have been developed with the help of the Jasmine framework.%"...Was dem testen eigenltlich nicht gerecht wird, aber man kann es in der thesis nciht anders darstellen..."
  
\section{Test environment}
The Jasmine test suites were run within Karma on Mac OSX operating system with Google Chrome. The hardware configuration was a dual core \ac{CPU} and 8096MB \ac{RAM}.

\section{Testing results}

\section{Acceptance test of the prototype}
Besides the technical testing of the application, we created an acceptance test for the smartphone-frontend-application and the web-backend-application.
